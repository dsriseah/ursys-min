/*///////////////////////////////// ABOUT \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*\

  this tsconfig is intended to improve intellisense in vscode

  .. the VSCODE typescript language server to provide Intellisense
  .. the VSCODE eslint plugin to provide live type checking and linting
  .. the eslint configuration to use typescript rules
  .. the esbuild tool to transpile typescript files to bundles
  .. the tsc typescript compiler to generate type declaration files
  .. npm workspaces with shared typescript imports and dependencies
  .. support for nodejs and web browser targets in the same npm workspace
  .. support of shared platform-independent typescript code for projects

  Maintaining compatibility between these systems is a challenge, as not
  all options apply to each system. Annotations are provided to explain
  which systems use each option.

  NOTE: URSYS is using tsx as the runtime to enable pure
  typescript execution in nodejs without transpilation.
